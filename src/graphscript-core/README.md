## Graphscript Core

`npm i graphscript-core`

Core library of the "graphscript" framework. Graphscript is framework for writing functional graphs that leverages the dynamic programming syntax in JavaScript to automate a great deal of your processes with minimal overhead, including cross-thread and backend communication using our extended Services libraries. This lets you focus on features, not boilerplate, in a minimal, natively executable, and extremely easy to read format for your core program logic. This can let you and your team members reason through problems more effectively and plug in modular code. 

See the docs for understanding the usage of this framework:

Refer to [./examples](`./examples`) for basic library usage.

The core library is 35kb minified. See the following Services repositories for building your full stack application:
